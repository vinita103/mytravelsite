    <h1>10 Things to do </h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        Whether you picture yourself dozing on the beach or hiking up a mountain, exploring underwater worlds or playing a round of golf, you won't be bored in Jamaica. The island can be especially terrific for active travelers. If you're staying in Ocho Rios, you should climb through Dunn's River Falls and Park. If you're in Montego Bay, you have to try out the best golf greens – particularly the Tryall Club or White Witch Golf Course. Negril is all about the sand – a Seven Mile stretch of it, to be specific. If you're on the hunt for some of the island's more heart-pumping activities like zip lining and ATV rides, sign up for one of the best tours in Jamaica.
