    <hr>
    <p> I recently went on a trip to Jamaica via Air Transat and spent an incredible five days in what felt like paradise!  The weather was warm and beautiful compared to the icy, snow-blanketed world I’d left behind. There’s really nothing like a little sunshine to lift your spirits. Keep reading for a broad overview of my Jamaican vacation. If you are planning a trip to Jamaica, I have all the details about vacationing in Jamaica with many the Montego Bay and Negril excursions.<br>
        You can also find other posts on Jamaica travel such as <a href="10Thingstodo.html">10 Things to do</a> in Jamaica. I hope all this information is helpful for when you go vacationing in Jamaica and Montego Bay.

    <h2>The Resort</h2>
    <p>
        We stayed at the brightly coloured, all-inclusive <a href="Royal_Decameron_Cornwall_Beach.html">Royal Decameron Cornwall Beach</a> in Montego Bay. Very Caribbean, relaxed kinds of vibes fill the resort—exactly the kind of ambience you want when you’re vacationing in Jamaica. The resort has an awesome pool and is beachfront. Plus, you can rent canoes and paddle boards on the beach if you’re looking for some fun day activities
